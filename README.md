# InterviewBuddy

InterviewBuddy is a real-time coding collaboration platform built using the MERN stack, Socket.io, and Tailwind CSS. It features JWT-based authentication and allows users to collaborate on coding problems in real-time.

## Use Case

InterviewBuddy is designed for coding interviews where interviewers and candidates need to collaborate in a shared coding environment. The platform provides real-time code synchronization, making it ideal for:
- **Technical Interviews**: Interviewers can assess candidates by sharing coding challenges and observing their problem-solving approach in real-time.
- **Mock Interviews**: Candidates can practice coding interviews with peers or mentors using a collaborative workspace.
- **Pair Programming**: Developers can work together on coding problems, debug code, and enhance productivity.

## Features

- **Real-time Code Collaboration**: Work on coding challenges together with live updates.
- **MERN Stack**: Uses MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
- **Socket.io**: Enables real-time communication between users.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure authentication system.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides a sleek and responsive UI.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Socket.io-client
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Socket.io, JWT
- **Database**: MongoDB
